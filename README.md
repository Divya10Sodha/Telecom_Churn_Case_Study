## General Information
- In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this project, customer-level data of a leading telecom firm was analyzed, predictive models were built to identify customers at high risk of churn and the main indicators of churn were identified.


## Conclusions
- According to our problem statement, we need to retain high value customers, since retaining customers require less budget than attracting new ones.

- To retain such customers, we need higher recall. As giving an offer to an user not going to churn will cost less as compared to loosing a customer and bring new customer, we need to have high rate of correctly identifying the true positives, hence recall.

- When we compare the models trained we can see the tuned XGBoost is performing the best, which has highest accuracy along with highest recall i.e. both 95% respectively. So, we will go with XGBoost, as it is giving the best results among all.
